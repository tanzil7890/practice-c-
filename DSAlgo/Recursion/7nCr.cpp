//Combination Formula:
/*
The combination formula is used to find the number of ways of selecting items from a collection, such that the order of selection does not matter. In simple words, combination involves the selection of objects or things out of a larger group where order doesnâ€™t matter. 
The formula for combination helps to find the number of possible combinations that can be obtained by taking a subset of items from a larger set. It shows how many different possible subsets can be made from the larger set.
