//Template for Competitive Programmers.
/*
Why we should use Template?
--> To follow DRY Principle.
--> To do Generic Programming.
It's like create one class --> and can also use the class for other dataTypes.

Why is it necessary?
To avoid writing of multiple classes for the change in data Type operation.

--> Template also known as Parameterized classes.

Syntax:
//Below classes represent many classes. 
template <class T>      //T can be anything like int, char, and etc.
class vector {
    T *arr;
    public:
        vector(T *arr){
            //code
        }
        //many other function and code.
}

//for main() function
int main(){
    vector <int> myVec(ptr);
    vector <float> myFVec(ptr1);
}

int main() {

    return 0;
