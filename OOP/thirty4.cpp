// Polymorphism {Poly - many}, {morphism - form}
// ex: like mall which have lot of different types of shop in it.
//(like one name multiple form)
//  eg: Function Overloading, Operator Overloading
//  eg: Virtual Functions
// Polymorphism are of two types: 1) Compile Time Polymorphism 2) Run Time Polymorphism
//  Can be achieved by 1.1) Function Overloading 1.2) Operator Overloading. Also known as Early or Static Binding. Binding done at the time of compilation according to the program written.
//  2.1) Run Time Polymorphism: Can be achieved by "Virtual Function". Also known as Late Binding.
