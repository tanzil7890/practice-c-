//Containers in STL.
/*
Containers Type:
1) Sequence Containers: Which store data in Linear Fashion. Like 7->9->11->2->0->40. Example: Vector, list, Dequeue.
2) Associative Containers: Direct Access(Faster Access). Ex: Set/MultiSet, Map/Multimap, and etc.
Ex: Tree Like structure.
     9
   /   \
  10    2

3) Derived Containers: Real World Modelling. Example: StacK(LIFO), Queue(FIFO), priority queue. Derived from Sequence/Associative Containers.


When to use which?

1) Sequence: i)Vector --> Random Access = Fast, Insertion/Deletion in middle = slow, Insertion at the end is fast.
            ii)List --> Random Access = Slow(because it moves with pointers helps), Insertion/Deletion in middle = slow, Deletion/Insertion at the end = Fast.

2) Associative: All operation fast except Random Access.

3) Derived Container: Depends on Data Structure.
