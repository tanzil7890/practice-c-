//STL(Standard Template Library)

/* 
It contains library of Generic Classes and functions.
STL is used because its a good idea not to reinvent the wheel.

Why STL?
To do things in Limited Time like:
1) Resize
2) Sort
3) Search

Why use STL?
To reuse well tested components.
To save time!


STL COMPONENTS:
1) Containers: To store data. And also use template classes. ex: vector.
2) Algorithms: Procedure to process data. like Sorting, Searching, and etc. Use template functions.
3) Iterators: Object, Which points to an element in a Container. Handled just like pointers.
Connects Algo with Containers.
